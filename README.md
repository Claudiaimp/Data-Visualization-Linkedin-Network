#### The project
The research question of the project was to understand whether the academic background of our classmates influenced their Linkedin networks. In order to carry out the research, we collected data from 18 of our classmates (upon their written consent). 

**Steps taken**:
1. Data collection and manipulation with Python and Excel in order to create a custom dataset;
2. Data analysis of the authors and network visualization with Python and Gephi;
3. Data analysis of the whole dataset of the 18 classmates with Python and Gephi;
4. Collection of insights and reporting;
5. Final delivery.

**Programming languages and libraries**
1. Excel;
2. Python (Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, NetworkX);
3. Gephi (Gephi requires .gml files that were recreated in Python).

**Disclaimer**:
Considering the subject of the inquiry, some part of the code and of the report will not be displayed for privacy reasons. 
The same goes for the data, that will not be publically available.
